Classroom resources for building an Arduino-based pinball machine

This repository contains documents I distribute to students when we are building pinball machines as part of an Engineering STEM course.
Since every pinball machine is different, I do not provide step-by-step instructions.  Instead, the documents are fairly general and cover
topics relevant to every build.  Designing and building a pinball machine is a complex process, but my students have enjoyed it 
immensely and found it very rewarding. 

An overview of the complex is presented in the document "Building pinball machines in a STEM fabrication course.pdf".

The project uses three Arduino Nano microcontrollers and several custom printed circuit boards.  The code for the Arduinos is provided, along
with the Gerber files required for having the PCB's fabricated by a commercial service like JLCPCB.
