Two sets of software are provided â€“ one set is the vanilla code that has not been tailored to a specific machine design, and the other set is the actual code for a machine that includes a drop-down target that resets on a timer, plays sounds for specific events, and has various lighting modes that are play-dependent.  Use the second set to give you ideas about how you might program your own play rules.
